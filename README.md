This method uses three machine learning models in Python to detect fraudulent transactions. The credit dataset from Kaggle will be used in this process.

This code was generated based on other scripts, and I adjusted the dataset and code to meet my requirements. This is my online internship assignment. I analyzed the accuracy and efficiency of three machine learning models using graphs.

Dataset: I downloaded this dataset from Kaggle, which includes 492 fraudulent transactions and 284315 rows of regular transactions. Owing to its size, I downsized the data set to 4007 rows, which include 516 fraudulent transactions and 3491 legitimate transactions.
